# Task

In a recent publication, Habibi et al. (2020) report a connection between neutrophil activity in volunteers’ airways and their susceptibility to infection from the cold virus RSV (see for example [this press release](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/206253/bacteria-fighting-cells-airways-boost-infection-risk/)).
Their findings are based on differential expression experiments and gene set enrichment analysis.
We would like your scientifically informed opinion on this publication. Are the results reproducible? Do they support the authors’ claim that neutrophil activation is predictive of RSV infection outcome? And can you think of (and try) other analysis steps that add insight? 

# Hints  

You'll find the pubplication and the published RNA-Seq data in this repository.  
For an overview on the analysis of RNA-Seq data, have a look at the `DESeq2` vignette.  
Further useful packages could be `pheatmap`, `biomaRt`, `clusterProfiler`, `glmnet`, and `randomForest`.  
There are also two helpful papers on cross-validation in the materials folder of this repository:  
+ Ambroise et al. (2002)
+ Ruschhaupt et al. (2004) (please read only Fig. 1 and p. 3)
