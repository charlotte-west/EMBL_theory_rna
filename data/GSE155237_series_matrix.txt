!Series_summary	"We report the analysis of nasal curettage cells by RNAseq collected at pre-symptomatic timepoints in healthy adults experimentally challenged with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Following inoculation, 57% of participants developed PCR-confirmed infection. Prior to viral challenge, 80 differentially expressed genes were identified that associated with susceptibility to symptomatic infection. At day 3, 87 differentially expressed genes were associated with protection. Thus, we showed that the nasal mucosa at the time of virus exposure and during the incubation phase correlate with susceptibiltiy and protection from respiratory viral infection."

Starting with 100 ng of total RNA, cytoplasmic ribosomal RNA was removed by hybridization to a biotinylated probe selective for ribosomal RNA species, followed by streptavidin bead binding and sample purification.  The resulting cytoplasmic rRNA-depleted sample was chemically fragmented and converted into single-stranded cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers, with the addition of Actinomycin D to suppress DNA-dependent synthesis of the second strand.  Double-stranded cDNA was created by removing the RNA template and synthesizing the second strand in the presence of dUTP in place of dTTP.  A single A base was added to the 3’ end to facilitate ligation of sequencing adapters, which contain a single T base overhang.  Adapter-ligated cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction to increase the amount of sequence-ready library.  During this amplification the polymerase stalls when it encounters a U base, rendering the second strand a poor template.

Starting with 100 ng of total RNA, cytoplasmic ribosomal RNA was removed by hybridization to a biotinylated probe selective for ribosomal RNA species, followed by streptavidin bead binding and sample purification.  The resulting cytoplasmic rRNA-depleted sample was chemically fragmented and converted into single-stranded cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers, with the addition of Actinomycin D to suppress DNA-dependent synthesis of the second strand.  Double-stranded cDNA was created by removing the RNA template and synthesizing the second strand in the presence of dUTP in place of dTTP.  A single A base was added to the 3’ end to facilitate ligation of sequencing adapters, which contain a single T base overhang.  Adapter-ligated cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction to increase the amount of sequence-ready library.  During this amplification the polymerase stalls when it encounters a U base, rendering the second strand a poor template.

"RNAseq cDNA library was prepared with TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Kit with Ribo-Zero Human/Mouse/Rat Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, #RS-122-2203). Starting with 100 ng of total RNA, cytoplasmic ribosomal RNA was removed by hybridization to a biotinylated probe selective for ribosomal RNA species, followed by streptavidin bead binding and sample purification.  The resulting cytoplasmic rRNA-depleted sample was chemically fragmented and converted into single-stranded cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers, with the addition of Actinomycin D to suppress DNA-dependent synthesis of the second strand.  Double-stranded cDNA was created by removing the RNA template and synthesizing the second strand in the presence of dUTP in place of dTTP.

Double-stranded cDNA was created by removing the RNA template and synthesizing the second strand in the presence of dUTP in place of dTTP.  A single A base was added to the 3’ end to facilitate ligation of sequencing adapters, which contain a single T base overhang.  Adapter-ligated cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction to increase the amount of sequence-ready library.  During this amplification the polymerase stalls when it encounters a U base, rendering the second strand a poor template.
